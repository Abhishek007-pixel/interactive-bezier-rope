# Interactive Bézier Rope

An interactive cubic Bézier curve that behaves like a springy rope.
The curve responds to mouse movement and visualizes tangents in real time.

## Features
- Manual cubic Bézier implementation
- Spring–damper physics for smooth motion
- Tangent visualization using curve derivatives
- Real-time interaction (60 FPS)

## How to Run
Use a local server (ES modules required):

```bash
python -m http.server
